### Abstract

Legacy effects of ecosystem engineering are changes to the physical environment that persist after the loss of either the engineering species, or its engineering activities. The duration of such legacy effects may be of interest, particularly when we are attempting to manage ecological systems in order to either mitigate or enhance such impacts. There are a variety of mechanisms which can determine the duration of legacy impacts that can be best understood by examining the relationship between the timescales of environmental decay of the engineering effect, population dynamics of the engineering species, and the potential for reinforcing feedbacks.


### Outline

1. What is an ecosystem engineering legacy effect?
	1. Engineering legacy effects are changes to the physical environment caused by an engineering species that persist after that individual or population, or the causal action that produced engineering, is lost to the system.
	2.  Often the definition of a legacy effect includes the idea of long duration. For example, Cuddington (2011) used the definition of “an indirect effect that persists for a long time period in the absence of the causal species, or after this species has ceased the causal activity”

2. What is the duration of ecosystem engineering impacts after the engineer is gone?
	1. Examples of long duration legacy effects include: the formation of a beaver meadow that can persist for nearly a century (Hastings et al. 2007), channels created by feral buffalo that allowed the ingress of saltwater to a freshwater floodplain and contributed to the retreat of a _Melaleuca_ swamp forest (Bowman et al. 2010) , soil compaction caused livestock grazing that can last for over 30 years and inhibit plant growth and seedling establishment (Sharrow 2007)
	2. However, legacy effects are not necessarily of long duration. Grman and Suding (2010) describe soil impacts from invasive species that occur within a single year as a legacy effect because these effects persist after species removal. There are examples from the literature of both short and long term legacy effects
	3. The question of duration has management implications. For example, management actions that focus only on the engineering species and and not the engineered physical aspects can lead to different outcomes than efforts that focus on both the physical structures and the species, where the engineering is able to persist. In addition, impact of the engineered structure on other species would also persist (Byers et al. 2006).

3. Even legacies of of the same type of ecosystem engineering can have different duration
	1.  In part the duration of the impact will be due to the particular environmental conditions, as we can see from the decay rate in simple models engineering (Cuddington et al 2009).  Engineering effects may not persist in high-energy systems, for example a burrow in a sandy intertidal region with high wave energy will quickly be filled in in the absence of the engineering species. Where the decay rate of engineered impacts is slow, however, we may have a long transient as the system relaxes to its pre-engineered state.
	2.  On the other hand, Reynolds et al. (2017) found both transient and persistent impacts of the same engineer (*Spartina spp.*), where the decay rate of buried roots was slow (long transient), while other impacts of the engineer persisted (alternate stable state) because of feedback in the form of other invaders that had been facilitated by the actions of the original engineer species. Similarly, positive feedbacks from subsequent soil engineers (ants, termites, earthworms, and woody plants) following agricultural activities can cause persistent physical change (McKey et al. 2010).
4.  We can clarify these issues by modelling the timescales of ecosystem engineering
	1.  We can consider that the engineering impacts could occur on a faster timescale than the dynamics of the engineer population, or on a slower timescale, or the same scale. This scaling will be determined by the environmental decay rates relative to the population dynamics of the engineering species.
	2.  It may be that legacy effects correspond specifically to the case were the timescale of decay is slower than population responses; although, this is not necessarily the case:
		1.  Where engineering and population dynamics occur on the same scale, there may be dynamic behaviours that produce long transients in the dynamics of ecosystem states (e.g., saddle-nodes crawlbys, Hastings et al. 2018)
		2.  There may also be alternative stable states, where the engineered state has feedbacks that allow it to persist independently of the original engineer population
